[00:13.94] They're waking you up to close the bar
[00:20.40] The street's wet, you can tell by the sound of the cars
[00:27.59] The bartender's singing "Clementine"
[00:34.03] While he's turning around the open sign
[00:41.00] "Dreadful sorry, Clementine"
[00:55.00] 
[00:54.46] Though you're still her man
[00:59.09] It seems a long time gone
[01:08.27] Maybe the whole thing's wrong
[01:15.09] What if she thinks so and just didn't say so?
[01:21.74] You drank yourself into slow-mo
[01:28.60] Made an angel in the snow
[01:35.51] Anything to pass the time
[01:41.79] And keep that song out of your mind
[01:59.29] 
[01:48.81] Oh, my darling
[01:52.12] Oh, my darling
[01:53.40] Oh, my darling, Clementine
[02:02.23] Dreadful sorry, Clementine
[02:16.05] Dreadful sorry, Clementine
