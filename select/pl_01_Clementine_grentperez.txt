I've been changing
But the burnin' stays the same
What can I do to tame
the heat of this fire?
Forever savin'
The remnants of a love
Like ancient stories told
from another time
Eternally painted on my mind
Mmm
Color it gray
Until I forget you
Like I never met you
My dearest Clementine
Throw it away
But close enough to you
'Cause although I hate you
I will still fall in love,
my Clementine
Every time, mmm
And if you're fadin'
Then honey I'll be fadin' too
Darling, I don't even know
who I am without you
Forever waitin'
Times never wasted and still
I find myself growin'
old over you
You came in a dream
You touched the depths
of my mind
Oh, no, no, no
Color it gray
Until I forget you
Like I never met you
My dearest Clementine
Throw it away
But close enough to you
'Cause although I hate you
I will still fall in love,
my Clementine
Every time, always
No matter how hard I try
My Clementine, every time
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Color it gray
Until I forget you
Like I never met you
My dearest,
my dearest Clementine
Color it gray
Until I forget you
Like I never met you (Oh, oh)
My dearest Clementine
Throw it away
But close enough to you
'Cause although I hate you
I will still fall in love,
my Clementine
Every time, always
No matter how hard I try
My Clementine, every time
Mmm, mmm
You're always on my mind
