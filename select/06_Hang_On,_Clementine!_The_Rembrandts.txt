It rained the night away, the day I left the mine
A banjo on my knee, Susannah, don't you cry
Our wagon lost a wheel, along the rocky wind
I'll make it up to you, my darlin' Clementine

Hang on, Clementine!
(Hang on)
Hang on, Clementine!
Hang on, Clementine!
(Hang on)
Hang on, Clementine!

I sold the farm for gold, that's how the story tells
Against your very will, I bought a wishing well, yes, I did
The days indeed were hard and fortune was not mine
I will return to you, my darlin' Clementine

Hang on, Clementine!
(Hang on)
Hang on, Clementine!
Hang on, Clementine!
(Hang on)
Hang on, Clementine!

Hang on, Clementine!
(Hang on)
Hang on, Clementine!
Hang on, Clementine!
(Hang on)
Hang on, Clementine!

Hang on, Clementine!
(Hang on)
Hang on, Clementine!
Hang on, Clementine!
(Hang on)
Hang on, Clementine!
